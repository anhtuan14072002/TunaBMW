    </b>
    <p>
        I am an experienced Business Analyst with a trong technical background an great project management skills.
        I am able to work oin multiple projects at the same time, which over the years at Network Solutions have lead to
        eight-digit effciencies for the business. Furthermore, I immensely enjoy the process of derving critical business
        insighes using analytics, and then supporting or directly mangaging the efficiency implementation projects. My ablity to move
        from analysis or leading a team of analysts tp supporting or leading the acctual project is something that could help further a accelerate the
        velocity of work at lon insights.
